We may seek to verify the accuracy of the data before rectifying it.<br><b>Erasure</b><br>You can ask us to erase your personal data, but only where:<br><li>• it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; or</li><br><li>• you have withdrawn your consent (where the data processing was based on consent); or</li><br><li>• following a successful right to object (see 'objection' below); or</li><br><li>• it has been processed unlawfully; or</li><br><li>• to comply with a legal obligation which TCT is subject to.</li><br>We are not required to comply with your request to erase your personal data if the processing of your personal data is necessary: for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

	<string name="privacy_policy_10_4"><![CDATA["<b>Objection</b><br>You can object to any processing of your personal data which has our 'legitimate interests' as its legal basis (see Appendix 1 for further details), if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. Once you have objected, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights.<br><b>Automated Decision Making</b><br>You can ask not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated processing (see Section 8), but only where that decision:<br><li>• produces legal effects concerning you (such as the rejection of a claim); or</li><br><li>• otherwise significantly affects you.</li><br>In such situations, you can obtain human intervention in the decision making, and we will ensure measures are in place to allow you to express your point of view, and/or contest the automated decision. Your right to obtain human intervention or to contest a decision does not apply where the decision which is made following automated decision making:<br><li>• is necessary for entering into or performing a contract with you; or</li><br><li>• is authorised by law and there are suitable safeguards for your rights and freedoms; or</li><br><li>• is based on your explicit consent.</li>"]]></string>
